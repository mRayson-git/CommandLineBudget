# CommandLineBudget
A simple budget application using mysql for the backend and a simple text interface for the front end. 

Using the Selenium library it can automatically retrieve financial reports on transactions from set financial institutions. Those reports are parsed for the necessary transaction information which is then inserted into the database (currently local). That database is then queried for the information pertaining to either the current or past month's budget and displays them in a clean table.
